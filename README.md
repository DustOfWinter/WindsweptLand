### About
---
Windswept Land is a text-based adventure game written in Java. I made this in 2012 or 2013 as a final project for my CS111 class. It's pretty simple and for the most part, pretty free of bugs (aside from a crash for when you look at yourself with no equipment, and an item duping bug that I never bothered to fix.) I'm uploading it here mostly because I thought I lost it, and recently found it on a long forgotten flash drive.
